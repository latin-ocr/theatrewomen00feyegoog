of maids betrothed, of wiveS, of widowS, of women veiled,
or consecrated to God. You as maid, betrothed, widow,
and all but entirely given up to pious reading and medi-
tation, are the model by whom they of every age, rank,
and condition, should test themselves and conform their
character—that is, if they long to run here the race of

· life without offence; and after its course is run, to enjoy

eternalbliss with God their Creator. Accept, therefore,
most potent and serene Queen, this small offering of my
no small affection and devotion to your Majesty.

And whereas other ladies are wont to receive a com·
pliment from books inscribed to them, do you, in accord-
anee with your happy geniuS, bestow on this little work
the reflection of your glory, and favoured by God and
men alike, long rejoice in the most abundant fruits of
your very many and great virtues. Farewell.

Your most Serene Majesty’s

Most devoted,

Srmsuuuo Fuuuunuuuor,

Citizen aad Printer es Franksort.
