Lasr TITLE, appears to be intended to denote the ordinary employments of
mankind in this sublunary state. At top are three infants, one of them in a

military dress beating a drum3 and below are two others, one of which has
a bow. The initials 1. A. are in the middle at bottom. This plate and the
twenty-three plates of studies which follow it, 'and complete the work, are ,
oblonga l. 10, h. 7. Having spoken of the omamentedtitles,1 shall add
now a few words concerning the other platcs.

The first twenty consist of perspective views of the five regular solids, and ·
of various forms fancifully derived from them; each plate containing six
designs in circles The subject of the first four platee, marked A, is the
Triangular Pyramid ; of the second four, marked E, the Octohedron; of
the third, 1, the Cube ; of the fourth, Ο, the Icosahedron; (two of these
having the initials L A. with the date 1567, and a third the initials only);
and the fifth, V, represent the Dodecahedron. The artist’s plan appears to
have been, first, to represent the figure itself, and such forms as are produced
by cutting parts from it ; secondly, to represent the figure itself, and its deri-
vatives, in another point of view; thirdly, to show such forms as may be
obtained by combining two of the simple figures in such a way as that the
angles of the one should proceed from the centres of the sides of the other.
The manner in which the complex figures have been obtained from the simple
ones can, for the most part, be easily traced; but sometimes, in consequence
of the arbitrary sections made in them, this becomes difficult.

Of the twenty-three plates at the end, the first two are marked A3 the
second two, E; the third, 13 the fourth 03 and the fifth, V3 and these ten
platos represent perspective views of the figures above named, hollowed out
and perforated3 the remaining thirteen being devoted to fanciful delineations
of the sphere, the cone, and the wheel. (B. 11.)

A second edition of this curious set of prints was published, with two leaves
of letter-press, at Amsterdam, in 1618, under the title of ‘Sintagma inquo
Variae Eximiaque corporum,' &a
