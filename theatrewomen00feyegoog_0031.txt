Ammon seems to have had an eye to business, as this cannot be accepted
as a pertrait, neither is it to be supposed that the Fuggers wore any special
costuma The Fuggers, though of mean origin, had risen by trading to great
wealth, and were the Rothschilds of the sixteenth century, and probably his
patrous. They werea numerous family, and had formed marriage-alliances
with most of the noble families of Germany. They were not Jews. Occa-
sional traces of tbe family are still found, such as almshouses with their
names recorded as founders ; but the only descendants now alive are said to
be in abject poverty.

About the period of the publication of this Book of Costumes, one of the
family, Huldric Fugger, a bibliomaniac, was pursued by his family in a court
of justice at Augsburg and declared incompetent to manage his property. The
special reason which satisfied the court of his incapacity was his purchase of
’ costly manuscripts, which be printed at the press of Henry Stephens. Biblio· Δ
maniacs of the present day would probably fare better in the Court of Chaucery.
Huldric retired to Heidelberg, and died in 1584.
