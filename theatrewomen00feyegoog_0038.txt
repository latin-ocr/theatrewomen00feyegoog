is the same with regard to linen, which Pliny, in his seventh
book, declares to be the gift of Arachne, a maid oi Lydia.
He was clearly ignorant of its use by the Hebrews so long
before the birth of Arachne, just as with regard to many
other things the bestowal of which the same Pliny and
otherprofane writers assign to different persons. Inthe same
way, the arts of spinning wool and weaving are assigned
by Ovid to Pallas, or, what,is much the same, by Trogus
or rather Justin, to the Athenian worshippers of Pallas,
and by Pliny to the Egyptians. So the art oi lulling, by
which garments are improved and brightened, is assigned
to one Nicias of Megara; sewing to some unknown Boe-
thius; embroidery to' the PhrygianS, whence the name of
Phrygiones, applied to those who work it, is derived ; many-
coloured robes to the Babylonians ; watered stuffs to Caia
Caecilia, who is identical with Tanaquil ; costly dalmatics
to the Dalmatians; and, on the other hand, the very low-
priced cilician dress to the Cilicians by Varro, Trogus
Diodorus and Pliny who has been already quoted. Silk
only, than which there is at the present day nothing
commoner, was both discovered later, and for a long
time more sparingly transmitted to us; since, even in '
the time ol the Emperor Aurelian, as Vopiscus relateS,
zie. in the year of grace 274, silk was valued at its
weight in gold. On this account, too, that most tem-
perate sovereign thought fit to refrain from the use of
robes all os silk, until, in the reign ol Justinian, as we
learn from Procopius, this material also became gradually
more abundant, and consequently cheaper. The vuse
of robeS, having arisen from such a commencement,
gradually advanced so far that personal adornment now
seems to be hampered by the elaboration of its means;
since day by day some new thing is devised by those artistS,
whose sole business is to pander to the passionate lovers
os dress, and especially to the more showy of women.
That sex is not only the more inclined by nature itself to
the pleasure and beauty os dresS, but als0, to confess the
truth, the want of moderatiori in men (ior whom those
women had no charms who did not assist their own special
