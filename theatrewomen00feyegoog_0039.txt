the sex to descend so far as to take the very highest account
ol perso'nal ornament and decoration, in order to retain
their husbands, by this species of enticement, in love and
admiration ior them.

This had not, indeed, been altogether amiss, although
excessively and over-nicely done, if here those arts of
allurement had stayed. But afterwards some men, not
even by this means contented with their own, began to
fix their hearts on other men's wives; making an ill
use ol their eyes as waylayers of the innocense of
their neighbours’ wives; and women were actually found
who delighted less to charm with their beauty their own
husbands than their neighbours. Forthwith, by license in

these words :-“ Come now,'’ he sayS, “if from the first
both the Milesians sheared sheep, and the Chinese spun
from the tree, and the Tyrians dyed, and the Phrygians
embroidered, and the Babylonians inwove‚ and if pearls
shone and rubies flashed; if gold itself, t00, came up
from the earth with the desire for it; and if now, too, no
lying but the mirror's were allowed, Eve, Ι suppose, would
have desired these things on her expulsion from Paradise,
and when spiritually dead. Therelore, she should now
neither desire nor know, is she desires to live again, what,
when she lived, she neither had nor knew. Accordingly,
