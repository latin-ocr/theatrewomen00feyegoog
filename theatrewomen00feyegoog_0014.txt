x INTRODUCTION.

Ammon's adoption, he was the chosen friend and

constant correspondent os the most distinguished men
of the day, amongst whom were Erasmus and Luther,
and he was moreover married to a handsome shrewish
wise, who embittered his domestic life and shortened his
days. His public life, his voluminous correspondence,
and the pranks of his unamiable consort, furnished ample
materials for his biographers; but Ammon's life was
played out in his studio, and we gather little from co·
temporary history to mark his career.

All that we know is, that he was bom in Zurich in
1539, removed to Nuremberg in 1560, and aiter thirty

the same year, in Iamo, with the text in Latin.

John Evelyn was born within thirty years of Ammon’s
death, and though professing and desiring in his Sculptura
to give an exhaustive catalogue os the engravers of mark,
dismisses our artist with two short notices, misnaming him
as often as he mentions him. This reticence is not to
be regretted, as Evelyn was credulous and deficient in
research. So eager was he to be exhaustive, that he
began the history of engraving with the specimens
on the shelves of our first parent Adam, and stated,
on the authority of Thomas Aquinas, in his work
De Ente et Essentia, that Adam described a book on
