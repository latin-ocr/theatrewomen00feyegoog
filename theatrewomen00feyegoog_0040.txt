all those things are equipments of a lost and dead woman,
prhpaded' so to speak, for the funeral procession.''

“A woman's toilet comprehends two species cultus and
ornatus. Cultus is the name we give to what is called her
toilet proper; ornatus, to what should be called her tollet ·
improper. The latter consists in gold, silver, precious ’
stones, and raiment3 the former, in attention to the hair
and skin, and those parts of the body which attract the
eye. The one we charge with secking admiration, the '
other with prostitution; so that hence you may see how
much of this is suitable to your training as a handmaid of
God, a training which you should consider to be formed of
the contrary qualities, namely, of humility and chastity.”

And again, in another passage :—“ Earth, forsooth, is'far
more gloriouS, because, after being wailed over in pestiferous

may be worn on the finger. How many hands are wasted
in order that a single joint may sparkle! If any hell there
were, it had assuredly ere now been disclosed by the borings
of avarice and luxury!’' Hence, as our author Tertullian
continues “ sor a very little caslret a great estate is
offered. ln a single dress a million sesterces are em-
broidered. Parks and islands are carried on aslender
neck. Thin ear-lobes hang out sor viewa whole estate;
and the left hand sports a bag of gold on every
finger. This is the strength of ambition—to carry the
capital of so great interests on one little body, and that

a woman's.'’ Presently, deriding that kind of luxury
