work in the figures, would have been one os the finest
woodcuts ever executed in this country. Is left to himself,
Nesbit would, with his executant powers, have overcome
any difficulties but the failure in the figures is fully

explained by the nalf statement of Savage—“ Mr. Nesbit
had the benefit os Mr. Thurston's observations in his

, retouchings.'’

·I wish we could claim for our countrymen the woodcut
of Vanity Fair in Mr.Shie1ds’ illustrations to Pilgrim’s
Progress. It is 7} by 4 inches in size. The figures are

. innumerable, and the German engraver has done sull

justice to the genius of the English designer. It certainly

Shields designed plates to illustrate a small edition of the
Histozy of tlte Plagwe, and photographs of the wood
blocks before cutting were fortunately taken: they were

the design, we should have had an important work of art.

In stating that we have lost the art of engraving in
England, it must not be inferred that the observation
applies to another branchos the graphic art-etching.
With the needle in the hands of Mr. George Cruikshank‚
Mr. Samuel Palmer, Mr. Haden, Mr. Millais, or Mr.Whistler,
the collector of art gems will never be at a loss to find

distinguished place, and his Book of Costumes has been
selected as aflording a good example of his work. Not·
withstanding his celebrity and industry as an artist,
painting, as he is believed to have done, on glass and
canvas‚ engraving on copper, and designing on wood, and,
as far as we know, outstripping all cotemporary German
artistS, we learn nothing of his domestic life. Albert
Durer, who preceded him, had a history beyond his

studio; he was the chief magistrate ol theb town of
