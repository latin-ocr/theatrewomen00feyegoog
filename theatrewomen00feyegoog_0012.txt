of fostering the art has hastened its downfall. The multi-
plication of copies, the large number of proofs struck off
before the prints appear, has necessitated the use of steel
and the introduction of a variety of executive methods,
which produce representations of the originals without
their spirit or refinement. The same cause which has
created so great a demand for engravings, has given
unusual activity to the publishing trade, and as nearly
every book and magazine must be illustrated, the demand
for woodcutting is proportionably great. Designing on
wood is a special art, requiring special knowledge aud
long practice, and the designers werenot to be found:
Jackson says that at one period there was only one in
England capable of drawing effectively on wood; but

’ whether the men could be found or not, the work had to

be done, as woodcutS, being capable of almost unlimited
multiplication, were necessary for cheap popular works.
The capacity of wood is limited. It can express, perhaps
better than copper, the strong contrasts of light and
shade, but trade necessities required that it should attempt
to do the work of copper; the tint tools were brought into
full use, and the result was an imperfect imitation ; the
value of the process is gone, and a poor, tame, and for
art purposes, a worthless plate, is produced.

A book published fifty years ago by Savage, on Deco-
rative Priating, illustrates these statements. He employed
some of the best artists of his time to fumish designs and
put them into the hands of the best woodcutters Some
of them are in imitation of mezzotint engravings, and
some of water-colour drawings. The former arefiat and
spiritless, falling to give an idea of the manner of the
artist designer; the latter, although laboriously worked
with many blocks, are so coarse and utterly bad as to
be beneath criticism. Amongst the engravings where
wood has been put to its legitimate use, we have
one cut by Charlton Nesbit‚ and designed by Thurston,
of singular interest. It is of large size, being γὲ inches
by 5. It represents a woody scene, with Rinaldo and
Armida in the foreground, and but for some imperfect
