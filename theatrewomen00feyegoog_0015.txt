contradicted that he had a complete series of natural
history and other works besides He hinted that his
good genius the angel Razael may have helped him a
bit, but whatever assistance he derived, he alone was equal
to the occasion.

The next author of note mentioning Ammon is the
French engraver Papillon, who published in 1760 his
Τ reatz'se on Wood Engravz'rzg. The illustrations, though
carelessly printed, exhibit skill and power. He not
unsrequently blunders ¹in his art history, and makes out
two Jobst Ammons, one os Zurich and one of Nurem·
berg, from his ignorance of the removal in 1560.

In Germany, able writers came to the front; Heinecken,
between 1768 and 1790, published at Dresden and Leipsic

largely srom Heinecken and Bartsch, and each os them
furnishes additional matter in aid of the history of wood-
engravmg.

In reference to the works of Ammon, Jackson says,
