xii INTRODUCTION.

works were not free. The eight-line verses accompanying

each figure were composed by Francis Modius, a distin-
guished commentator of the time, and the preface was the
work of Sigismund Feyerabendt. The F eyerabendts had

been for generations scholarly publishers at Frankfort-on· '

the-Maine. If Papillon could be trusted, we might say Α
that the different branches of the family were celebrated
for painting, engraving, and for original works in prose
and poetry, but as Papillon's authority is so questionable,
we must content ourselves with saying that Sigismund
Feyerabendt was known as an author and artist, now
illustrating bibles with woodcuts, now editing learned
works.

However imperfect the above notice of Ammon, of his

art, and of his literary assistants‚ the subscribers to the
ι HOLBEIN SOCIETY may trust to the faithful rendering of
the fac-simile of the volume, under the skilful hands of
Mr. BROTHERS, and it only remains to express our grate·
ful sense of obligation to Mr. RICHARD SMITH, of Balliol
College, Oxford, for the translation of the preface.
. The following list of Ammon's works is taken from a
fragment of a Dictionary of Engravers published in 1831,
by William Young Ottley. He broke down when he had
reached the letter B, finding life too short for the enter·
prise he designed. Ottley's list does not contain the rarest
of Ammon's books-Charta Lusoria Jodoci Antmonni, a
4to. volume, published at Nuremberg in 1588. It con-
tained fifty-five woodcuts of cards, with illustrative verses
by the Imperial Poet Laureate, J. H. Schrbter. Although
termed Charta Lusoria, they were evidently not meant
to play with. In arranging a catalogue of works brought
out by Ammon, much care and discrimination is necessary, -
as, after his death, we find his woodcuts used by various
German publishers to decorate their books.
