LIST OF AMMON’S WORKS. xix

&c In the centre of the print is Truth, ‘Veritas‘ represented by a
winged female, standing with a large open book under her lest arm, in
which is written ‘Ecce Agnus Dei qui tollit peccata Mundi,' and her
right hand pointing to heaven: on each side of her is another winged
female; that on her right being in the act of baptising an infant whose
father and mother kneel below, whilst the other is employed in adminis-
tering the eucharist. Within an arch, under the figure of Truth, is hell;
and on the ground below are eight prostrate, or kneeling figures, denoting
Sin, Contrition, Penitence, dcc, distinguished by letters of the alphabet,
A to H, of which the explanations are given in papers printed with
moveable type, in two tablets at bottom, similar to those in the other
print. The inscription in the tablet, at top, commences: ‘Christus
Venite ad me omnes,' dcc. In the middle, near the bottom, Ι. Α. 3 and
underneath, ‘Ios Ammon F. M.D.LXXI.’ These two prints, from
their dimensions‚ and the care with which they are executed, merit
perhaps to be considered as the artist’s most capital performances on
copper. lt is remarkable that neither Heinecken nor Bartsch appears to
have been acquainted with them. (Ο.)

24 Tua Srounrruc on A Fouurrran Towu. The walls of the city, forti-
* fied by various round towers, are on the left; the attack is made
simultaneously by cannon, bombshells, and infantry scaling the walls;
and on the right are two large bodies of troops drawn up iu squares. At
bottom, near the left corner of the print, are the initials 1. A, the former
letter intersecting the first stroke of the latter; and within the lower
division of the A. is a small capital G, the singificatiou of which is un·
known to me. Three inches further to the right is the date ‘1564’ In
different parts of this plate are letters of reference, showing it to have
been accompanied originally by letter-press. It is undoubtedly by
Jobst Amman, and though slightly etched‚ is full of spirit l. 22,
Ιι. ul. (0.)

25. A Vrrw oa Α Sunii Fowrrrrnn Towrv, uv Nrcur, with numerous per-
sons, some in a carriage, and others on foot and on horseback, witness·
ing a display of rockets and other fireworks which are thrown from the
walls and bastions. Towards the right, at bottom, ‘1570. Jos. Α mmanE'
Bartsch supposes this plate to have been engraved with the burin, but I
think it chiefly done by etching. The figures and horses are admirably
varied in their grouping and attitudeS, and the effect of night is finely
represented. On the whole it is a masterpiece. l. 13211. ὃξ. (B. 14)
