DEDICA TION. xxxvii

η as the ground of its folly, inasmuch as gold and gems, Ι

which ladies esteem so highly, are common and con-
temptible in the eyes of many, he says: “Among certain
barbariam, because gold is an abundant product of their
own soil, they keep their prisoners in golden fetters, and
load malefactors with wealth, the more lavish as they are
the more guilty. Sometimes, in fact, instances have been
found of the absence of even the love of gold. The noble-
ness of precious stones, t00, we see at Rome, blushing at
the disdain of the Parthians and Medes and other kindred

indeed, such as are not worn for display. Hidden in their

he could, he would not: what God worrld not may not
lawfully be contrived. Those things, therefore, are not
naturally the best which are not from God, the author of
nature. Thus they are understood to be from the devil,
the disturber of nature.”

Finally, therefore, he bids Christian women to leave
such things to heathen and unbelieving women. “Let

· them,'' he continues “ strive to please their husbands by

this luxury; but go ye forth equipped with the cosmetics
and adornments of the Apostles taking fairness from single·
ness of heart, colour from modesty, painting your eyes with
reverence and your lips with silence, wearing in your ears
the word of God, and encircling your neck with the yoke
