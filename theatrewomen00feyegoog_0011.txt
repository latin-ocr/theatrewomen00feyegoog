ITH Blake‚ with the pupils of Bewick, and the
contemporaries of Turner, the English school of
engraving died out.* Thencelorth those who might have
continued it successfully‚ devoted themselves to the easel,
to drawing sor book-illustration, or to the profitable super·
intendence of those mechanical works by which the public

alpe made acquainted with the works of the artists of
t eday.

The explanation is not difficult; the money rewards
were slight, the honours lew; there was no court patronage‚
and no blue ribbon from the Academy; the work was

given to English engraving, we must go back a generation and recall the
works oi this great artist before he adopted a theatrical treatment to satisl'y
the debased requirements of modern picture-buyers‚ and contemplate the two
finest works which ever came from his easel, the Shepherd's Chies Moumer
and the Shepherd's Grave. Visitors to the Manchester Art Treasures will
not easily sorget the latter. Over both these picturas the memory lingers
tenderly‚ and it is same enough sor the late George Phelps Gibbon to say
that he has rendered with absolute fidelity the pathetic sentiment of the
master, aud that the executive skill is scarcely inferior to that shown in the
finest os modern prints. ¹
